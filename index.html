        <li>Machine Learning</li>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.5rem">
          This was a graduate course since it contained some topics of ML Theory
          as well. It was my first official ML course where I learned some of
          the theoretical foundations and topics ranging from classics like
          random forests and mixture models to Neural Networks and RL. And I
          implemented some methods from scratch, like MAP, SVM and MLP. I got
          19.3 out of 20. The final project was also Nueral Style Transfer.
        </p>
        <li>Stochastic Processes</li>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.5rem">
          This was my first advanced probability course, I got 20 out of 20. We
          learned about Markov Chains and its variations, Poisson and Gaussian
          processes, martingals and many other topics. The final project and my
          extra project was about MCMC: Metropolis Hastings algorithm, where I
          was introduced to sampling methods.
        </p>
        <li>High-Dimensional Probability Analysis</li>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.5rem">
          This is a graduate course where we study probabilistic methods and
          concentration inequalities in high-dimensional spaces, with
          applications in areas such as machine learning, random matrix theory,
          and statistics. I am currently studying this course.
        </p>
        <li>Theory of Machine Learning</li>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.5rem">
          This is a graduate course where we learn many of the mathematical
          concepts of today's Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I am currently
          studying this course.
        </p>
        <li>Statistical Learning</li>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.5rem">
          In this course I learned a formal statistical learning view that is
          incorporated in ML. This was an introductory course compared to the
          last ones I mentioned.
        </p>
        <li>Linear Algebra, Game Theory</li>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.5rem">
          These courses were also among my favorite courses.
        </p>
        <li>
          Probability and its applications, Statistics and its applications
        </li>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.5rem">
          These are also foundation courses that I enjoyed.

        <li>
          Databases, Data Structures and Algorithms, Advanced Programming,
          Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Principles of Computer Systems,
          Numerical Analysis, Automata and Theory of languages
        </li>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.5rem">
          These courses also helped me through my CS journy and are foundations
