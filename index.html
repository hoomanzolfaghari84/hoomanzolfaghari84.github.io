          and reasoning behind everything, which drives my research into the
          mathematical concepts of Machine Learning.
          <br />
          <br />
          Recently, I’ve had the opportunity to work on exciting research
          projects. you can see my research experience

      <h5>Research Interests</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Machine Learning Theory</li>
        <p>
          I am interested in understanding the theoretical aspects of ML and
          specially Deep Learning. Proving guarantees on how "well" learning
          algorithms can estimate functions and distributions. Another general
          goal of mine is to develop machine learning algorithms for data and
          information from infinite-dimensional spaces.Topics related to
          high-dimensional probability analysis, stochastic processes and
          specially Gaussian Processes, probability-based algorithms and
          statistical learning and inference are some of the related topics I
          like.
        </p>

        <li>Generative Deep Learning</li>
        <p>
          Learning complex, high-dimensional data distributions is a useful and
          fundumetally important task in ML. This is a really exciting and
          beautiful area.
        </p>

        <li>Geometric Deep Learning</li>
        <p>
          I enjoy understaing Geometric views and concepts in ML and DL. And
          extending traditional learning algorithms and models to work with
          non-Euclidean data, such as graphs. GDL tries to provide a unified
          framework to learn and generalize from structured data by
          incorporating geometric priors into the models.
        </p>
      </ul>
      I have not had the opportunity yet, but I would like to gain more research
      experience in the following topics as well:
      <ul>
        <li>Causal Inference</li>
        <p>
          By shifting the focus of learning from finding correlations to
          discovering causality, we can create more advanced learning algorithms
          and overcome the limitations of correlation-based methods.
        </p>

        <li>Trustworthy ML</li>
        <p>
          If ML algorithms are to be deployed in critical real-world
          applications, it is essential to ensure their safety and understand
          the risks involved.
        </p>
      </ul>

      Additionally, I find the following topics interesting:
      <ul>
        <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
        <li>Randomized Algorithms and Sampling Algorithms</li>
        <li>Computational Neuroscience</li>
        <li>Game Theory</li>
      </ul>

          This was a graduate course since it contained some topics of ML Theory
          as well. It was my first official ML course where I learned some of
          the theoretical foundations and topics ranging from classics like
          random forests and mixture models to Neural Networks and RL. And I
          implemented some methods from scratch, like MAP, SVM and MLP. I got
          19.3 out of 20. The final project was also Nueral Style Transfer.

            In this paper we work on providing a proper metric on the space of
            vertex-featured graphs, which has appropriate behavior for Machine

            I had the opportunity to introduce many ideas and objectives, create

            I was greatly supported by the team and had a great experience for
            writing my first academic paper. I also delved into the field of

            of learning functions defined on the space of all vertex-featured
            graphs. Along the journy I tackled with metric learning and few-shot
